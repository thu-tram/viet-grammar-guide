# Lesson 9: Location with "ở"

To talk about where someone or something is located, Vietnamese uses the word **ở**. It functions much like the English words "at," "in," or "on," depending on the context.

### Positioning with "ở"

When you want to say where something is, the standard pattern is simply: **Subject + ở + Location**.

<pre>
Tôi <b>ở</b> nhà.
"I am <b>at</b> home."
</pre>

<pre>
Sữa <b>ở</b> trong tủ lạnh.
"The milk is <b>in</b> the fridge."
</pre>

### Action + Place

If there is an action, **ở** usually follows the verb to show where the action is happening.

<pre>
Em ăn cơm <b>ở</b> trường.
"I eat rice <b>at</b> school."
</pre>

<pre>
Chúng tôi gặp nhau <b>ở</b> quán cà phê.
"We met each other <b>at</b> the café."
</pre>

### Asking for Location

To ask "where?", use the phrase **ở đâu**. The question word stays in the same position where the answer would be.

<pre>
Bạn sống <b>ở đâu</b>?
"You live <b>where</b>?" (Where do you live?)
</pre>

<pre>
Sách của tôi <b>ở đâu</b>?
"My book is <b>where</b>?" (Where is my book?)
</pre>

### Location vs. Existence

It is important to notice the difference between **ở** and **có**. While **có** focuses on the *existence* of something ("There is milk"), **ở** focuses on the *location* of a specific thing ("The milk is in the fridge").

<pre>
Trong tủ lạnh <b>có</b> sữa. (Existence)
"In the fridge (there) <b>is</b> milk."
</pre>

<pre>
Sữa <b>ở</b> trong tủ lạnh. (Location)
"The milk is <b>in</b> the fridge."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy đang <b>ở</b> công ty.
"He is <b>at</b> the office right now."
</pre>

<pre>
Mẹ đang nấu ăn <b>ở</b> trong bếp.
"Mom is cooking <b>in</b> the kitchen."
</pre>

<pre>
Chìa khóa <b>ở</b> trên bàn.
"The key is <b>on</b> the table."
</pre>

### Note on flexibility

In very casual speech, especially with common locations, you might sometimes hear people drop **ở** if the meaning is perfectly clear (e.g., "Tôi nhà" meaning "I'm (at) home"). However, using **ở** is the standard way to ground an action or a person in a specific place.
