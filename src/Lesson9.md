# Lesson 9: Location with “ở”

To talk about where someone or something is located, Vietnamese uses the word **ở**. It functions much like the English words "at," "in," or "on," depending on the context.

When you want to say something is simply _at_ a place, the structure is usually: **Subject + ở + Location**.

<pre>
Tôi ở nhà.
“I am at home.”
</pre>

If there is an action involved, **ở** typically comes after the verb to show where the action is happening.

<pre>
Em ăn cơm ở trường.
“I eat rice at school.”
</pre>

To ask "where?", you use the phrase **ở đâu**. In Vietnamese questions, the question word usually stays in the same position where the answer would be.

<pre>
Bạn sống ở đâu?
“Where do you live?”
</pre>

It is important to notice the difference between **ở** and **có** (which we saw in the last lesson). While **có** focuses on the _existence_ of something ("There is milk"), **ở** focuses on the _location_ of a specific thing ("The milk is in the fridge").

<pre>
Sữa ở trong tủ lạnh.
“The milk is in the fridge.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy đang ở công ty.
“He is at the office right now.”
</pre>

<pre>
Chúng tôi gặp nhau ở quán cà phê.
“We met each other at the café.”
</pre>

<pre>
Sách của tôi ở đâu?
“Where is my book?”
</pre>

<pre>
Mẹ đang nấu ăn ở trong bếp.
“Mom is cooking in the kitchen.”
</pre>

### Note on flexibility

In very casual speech, especially with common locations, you might sometimes hear people drop **ở** if the meaning is perfectly clear. However, using **ở** is the standard way to ground an action or a person in a specific place. You will see it used with both general areas (like a city) and specific spots (like "on the table").
