# Lesson 38: Concurrence and simultaneity

Sometimes you want to show that two things are happening at the exact same time. Vietnamese has a few ways to describe this "overlap."

### Doing two things at once (**vừa ... vừa ...**)

To say someone is doing two things simultaneously, use the pattern **vừa [Action A] vừa [Action B]**.

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>vừa đi vừa</b> hát.
“He is <b>singing while walking</b>. (He <b>just walk just sing</b>.)”
</pre>

This can also be used for two qualities:

<pre>
Món này <b>vừa ngon vừa</b> rẻ.
“This dish is <b>both delicious and</b> cheap.”
</pre>

### While (**trong khi**)

Use **trong khi** to link two separate events that are happening at the same time.

<pre>
<b>Trong khi</b> tôi nấu cơm, anh ấy đọc báo.
“<b>While</b> I cook rice, he reads the newspaper.”
</pre>

### Same time (**cùng lúc / cùng một lúc**)

If you want to emphasize that two distinct events happen at the "same moment," use **cùng lúc**.

<pre>
Hai người nói <b>cùng lúc</b>.
“Two people spoke <b>at the same time</b>.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Em <b>vừa học vừa</b> nghe nhạc.
“I am <b>studying and</b> listening to music (at the same time).”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Trong khi</b> chờ đợi, chúng ta uống trà nhé.
“<b>While</b> waiting, let's drink some tea.”
</pre>

<pre>
Mưa <b>vừa to vừa</b> kéo dài.
“The rain was <b>both heavy and</b> long-lasting.”
</pre>

<pre>
Đừng làm nhiều việc <b>cùng một lúc</b>.
“Don't do many things <b>at the same time</b>.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

The **vừa ... vừa ...** pattern is very popular in daily speech. It’s a rhythmic way to describe a scene or a person. Pay attention to how it can also be used to show a sequence of two things happening quickly, like **vừa mới** (just happened). For now, use it to describe multitasking—one of the most common ways to show simultaneity!
