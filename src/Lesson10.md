# Lesson 10: Basic negation with “không”, “chưa”, “chẳng”

Negating a statement in Vietnamese is quite straightforward. You generally place a negation word directly before the verb or adjective you want to negate. The three most common words for this are **không**, **chưa**, and **chẳng**.

### **không** (Not / No)

This is the standard, all-purpose negation. It is used for facts, habits, or general statements.

<pre>
Tôi không đói.
“I am not hungry.”
</pre>

### **chưa** (Not yet)

One of the most important patterns in Vietnamese is the distinction between "not" and "not yet." If something hasn't happened but _might_ or _should_ happen in the future, you use **chưa**.

<pre>
Tôi chưa ăn cơm.
“I haven't eaten yet.”
</pre>

### **chẳng** (Not at all / Not really)

This is a more casual and sometimes more emphatic way of saying "not." It often carries a bit of emotion or a dismissive tone.

<pre>
Nó chẳng nói gì cả.
“He didn't say anything at all.”
</pre>

### Word Placement

In all these cases, the negation word comes right before the action or the quality. Unlike English, which sometimes uses "don't," "doesn't," or "isn't," Vietnamese keeps it simple by just swapping the negation word.

<pre>
Anh ấy không đi làm.
“He is not going to work.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Em không biết.
“I don't know.”
</pre>

<pre>
Trời chưa mưa.
“It hasn't rained yet.”
</pre>

<pre>
Họ chẳng bao giờ đến muộn.
“They are never late (They don't ever come late).”
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi không thích trà, tôi thích cà phê.
“I don't like tea; I like coffee.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

The choice between **không** and **chưa** is very common in daily life. If someone asks if you've done something, answering with **chưa** is often more natural than **không**, because it implies that you might do it later. As you immerse more, you'll start to feel the slight "attitude" that **chẳng** adds to a sentence.
