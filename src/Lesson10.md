# Lesson 10: Basic negation with "không", "chưa", "chẳng"

To negate a statement in Vietnamese, you generally place a negation word directly before the verb or adjective you want to negate. The three most common words are **không**, **chưa**, and **chẳng**.

### Universal negation with "không"

This is the standard, all-purpose negation. It is used for facts, habits, or general statements.

<pre>
Tôi <b>không</b> đói.
"I am <b>not</b> hungry."
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>không</b> đi làm.
"He is <b>not</b> going to work."
</pre>

### The "not yet" concept with "chưa"

One of the most important patterns in Vietnamese is the distinction between "not" and "not yet." If something hasn't happened but might or should happen in the future, you use **chưa**.

<pre>
Tôi <b>chưa</b> ăn cơm.
"I have <b>not</b> eaten <b>yet</b>."
</pre>

<pre>
Trời <b>chưa</b> mưa.
"It has <b>not</b> rained <b>yet</b>."
</pre>

### Emotional negation with "chẳng"

This is a more casual and sometimes more emphatic way of saying "not." It often carries a bit of emotion or a dismissive tone.

<pre>
Nó <b>chẳng</b> nói gì cả.
"He did <b>not</b> say anything at all!"
</pre>

### Pre-verb placement

In all these cases, the negation word comes right before the action or the quality. Unlike English, which sometimes uses "don't," "doesn't," or "isn't," Vietnamese keeps it simple by just swapping the negation word.

<pre>
Họ <b>chẳng bao giờ</b> đến muộn.
"They <b>never</b> come late (not ever)."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Em <b>không</b> biết.
"I <b>don't</b> know."
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi <b>không</b> thích trà.
"I <b>don't</b> like tea."
</pre>

<pre>
Mai <b>chưa</b> về.
"Mai has <b>not</b> returned <b>yet</b>."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

The choice between **không** and **chưa** is very common in daily life. If someone asks if you've done something, answering with **chưa** is often more natural than **không**, because it implies that you might do it later. As you immerse more, you'll start to feel the slight "attitude" that **chẳng** adds to a sentence.
