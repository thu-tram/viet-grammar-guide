# Lesson 14: Time words and time placement


Picture yourself in a bustling Vietnamese market, needing to catch a train, or arranging to meet a friend -- knowing how to ask and tell the time transforms these moments from stressful to smooth. Time expressions are among the most practical phrases you'll use every single day when speaking Vietnamese.

Vietnamese time-telling follows wonderfully logical patterns that become second nature once you learn the building blocks. With the right foundation, you'll confidently handle everything from quick time checks to detailed scheduling conversations.

How do I ask and tell the time in Vietnamese?
---------------------------------------------

Two questions will handle every time-asking situation you encounter in Vietnam. Both are equally common and work in any setting, from casual street conversations to formal business meetings. The most frequently heard question is *Mấy giờ rồi?* (What time is it?).

The most frequently heard question is *Mấy giờ rồi?* (What time is it?). Vietnamese speakers also use *Bây giờ là mấy giờ?* (What time is it now?) for a slightly more formal tone.

Here's how a typical exchange sounds:

-   Question: *Mấy giờ rồi?* (What time is it?)

-   Answer: *Bây giờ là hai giờ.* (It's two o'clock now.)

Vietnamese time expressions follow predictable patterns that make learning them straightforward. The sections ahead break down each component step by step, so you'll master every variation with confidence.

The numbers you need before you start
-------------------------------------

Mastering Vietnamese numbers 1-24 unlocks every single time expression you'll encounter. These numbers form the backbone of telling time, whether you're catching a bus at *sáu giờ* (six o'clock) or scheduling a meeting at *hai mười giờ* (twenty o'clock). If you want extra practice with counting, we recommend reviewing our guide on [Vietnamese numbers (how to count)](https://preply.com/en/blog/vietnamese-numbers-how-to-count/) for additional support.

Here are the numbers that power every Vietnamese time phrase:

|

-   *một* (one)

-   *hai* (two)

-   *ba* (three)

-   *bốn* (four)

-   *năm* (five)

-   *sáu* (six)

-   *bảy* (seven)

-   *tám* (eight)

-   *chín* (nine)

-   *mười* (ten)

-   *mười một* (eleven)

-   *mười hai* (twelve)

 |

-   *mười ba* (thirteen)

-   *mười bốn* (fourteen)

-   *mười lăm* (fifteen)

-   *mười sáu* (sixteen)

-   *mười bảy* (seventeen)

-   *mười tám* (eighteen)

-   *mười chín* (nineteen)

-   *hai mười* (twenty)

-   *hai mười một* (twenty-one)

-   *hai mười hai* (twenty-two)

-   *hai mười ba* (twenty-three)

-   *hai mười bốn* (twenty-four)

 |

Practice reading through this list aloud several times to build muscle memory with Vietnamese time vocabulary.

Core patterns for saying the time
---------------------------------

Vietnamese time phrases follow predictable formulas built around *giờ* (hour). Once you master these four core patterns, you'll handle any time situation with confidence.

### Full hours with *giờ*

For exact hours, combine the number with *giờ*:

-   *một giờ* (one o'clock)

-   *năm giờ* (five o'clock)

-   *mười ba giờ* (thirteen o'clock)

The 24-hour format simply continues counting past twelve -- *mười ba giờ*, *mười bốn giờ*, and beyond.

### Half past with *rưỡi*

Add *rưỡi* (half) after any hour to express "half past":

-   *hai giờ rưỡi* (half past two)

-   *bảy giờ rưỡi* (half past seven)

-   *mười một giờ rưỡi* (half past eleven)

This pattern works universally across all hours, making it one of your most practical time tools.

### Minutes past the hour

Follow this formula: number + *giờ* + minutes. The word *phút* (minute) adds clarity but remains optional:

-   *ba giờ mười lăm* (three fifteen)

-   *năm giờ hai mười phút* (five twenty)

### Minutes to the next hour with *kém*

Use *kém* (less than) with the upcoming hour to express minutes before:

-   *bảy giờ kém mười* (ten to seven)

-   *mười hai giờ kém mười lăm* (quarter to twelve)

Always remember to name the next hour when using *kém* -- this catches many learners off guard initially.

12-hour or 24-hour? When to choose each one
-------------------------------------------

In everyday conversation, Vietnamese speakers typically use the 12-hour format with additional time markers to clarify morning, afternoon, or evening. However, official schedules, transportation timetables, and business contexts often rely on the 24-hour system for precision and clarity.

|

Context

 |

12-hour format

 |

24-hour format

 |
|

Casual conversation

 |

*bảy giờ tối (7 PM)*

 |

*mười chín giờ (19:00)*

 |
|

Transportation schedules

 |

*sáu giờ sáng (6 AM)*

 |

*sáu giờ (06:00)*

 |
|

Business meetings

 |

*hai giờ chiều (2 PM)*

 |

*mười bốn giờ (14:00)*

 |

Both formats are widely understood throughout Vietnam, but choosing the right one depends on your situation and who you're speaking with. When in doubt, follow the lead of the Vietnamese speakers around you.

Words that place the time in the day
------------------------------------

Vietnamese speakers often add time-of-day markers instead of using AM/PM equivalents, making conversations sound more natural and specific. These words help you place any hour within the right part of the day, whether you're making plans or describing your schedule. For more everyday vocabulary like this, see our guide on [basic words in Vietnamese](https://preply.com/en/blog/basic-words-in-vietnamese/).

Here are the five time markers that Vietnamese speakers use throughout the day:

-   *sáng* (morning) -- 5:00-11:00

-   *trưa* (noon) -- 11:00-13:00

-   *chiều* (afternoon) -- 13:00-18:00

-   *tối* (evening) -- 18:00-22:00

-   *đêm* (night) -- 22:00-5:00

You can combine these markers with any hour to create natural-sounding time expressions: *tám giờ sáng* (eight in the morning) flows much better than simply saying *tám giờ* (eight o'clock).

Practice telling the time with exercises
----------------------------------------

Now it's time to test your understanding with some practical exercises. We've designed these to help you apply what you've learned about Vietnamese time vocabulary -- try completing them before looking at the answers at the end of this article.

### Fill-in-the-blank sentences

Write the Vietnamese time expression for each English time:

1.  4:15 AM: ________________

2.  1:30 PM (24-hour format): ________________

3.  8:50 PM: ________________

4.  12:00 noon: ________________

5.  2:05: ________________

### Pronunciation drill

Practice saying these tricky Vietnamese time words aloud. Focus on the tone patterns and repeat each word several times:

1.  *giờ* (hour) -- pronounced with a falling tone

2.  *rưỡi* (half) -- ends with a rising-glottal tone

3.  *kém* (less than/to) -- starts with a light "k" sound

Check your pronunciation against these guides:

1.  *giờ* -- Practice the falling tone, similar to saying "juh" with a downward inflection

2.  *rưỡi* -- The tone rises then drops sharply, ending with an "uh-ee" sound

3.  *kém* -- Keep the "k" sound light and let the tone drop quickly on the single syllable

FAQs about telling the time in Vietnamese
-----------------------------------------

### How do you say quarter past and quarter to in Vietnamese?

Quarter past uses *mười lăm* (fifteen) after the hour, like *sáu giờ mười lăm* (quarter past six). Quarter to uses *kém mười lăm* with the next hour, like *bảy giờ kém mười lăm* (quarter to seven).

### When should I use the word *phút* in Vietnamese time expressions?

The word *phút* (minute) is optional in most time expressions. Vietnamese speakers often drop it in casual conversation, saying *hai giờ năm* instead of *hai giờ năm phút* for 2:05.

### Can I use both 12-hour and 24-hour formats interchangeably?

While both formats are understood, context matters. Use 12-hour format with time markers like *sáng* or *tối* for daily conversation, and 24-hour format for official schedules or formal situations
