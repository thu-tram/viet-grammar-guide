# Lesson 14: Time words and time placement

In Vietnamese, talking about _when_ something happens is very flexible. You can put time words either at the very beginning of the sentence or at the very end.

### Setting the Scene (Time at the Start)

Putting the time at the beginning is very common. It sets the context for everything you're about to say.

<pre>
Hôm qua tôi đi Hà Nội.
“Yesterday I went to Hanoi.”
</pre>

### Adding Detail (Time at the End)

You can also place the time at the end. This often feels like you are adding the "when" as a secondary detail.

<pre>
Tôi đi Hà Nội hôm qua.
“I went to Hanoi yesterday.”
</pre>

### Common Time Words

- **Bây giờ**: Now
- **Hôm nay**: Today
- **Hôm qua**: Yesterday
- **Ngày mai**: Tomorrow
- **Sáng nay**: This morning
- **Tối nay**: Tonight

### No Conjugation Needed

Remember, Vietnamese verbs don't change their form. The time word itself does all the work of telling the listener if the action is in the past, present, or future.

<pre>
<b>Ngày mai</b> tôi làm việc.
“<b>Tomorrow</b> I (will) work.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
<b>Bây giờ</b> em bận rồi.
“I am busy <b>now</b> (already).”
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ăn cơm <b>lúc 7 giờ</b>.
“I eat rice <b>at 7 o'clock</b>.”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Năm sau</b> chúng tôi kết hôn.
“<b>Next year</b> we (will) get married.”
</pre>

<pre>
Gặp lại bạn <b>sau nhé</b>!
“See you <b>later</b>!”
</pre>

### Note on flexibility

While you can put time in either spot, placing it at the front is a great way to "anchor" your sentence. If you have multiple time words (like "this morning at 9 AM"), the larger time period usually comes before the smaller one. As you listen, you'll see that Vietnamese speakers often drop the time entirely if it’s already clear from the conversation.
