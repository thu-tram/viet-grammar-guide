# Lesson 39: Relative-clause-like noun modification

In English, we use words like "that," "which," or "who" to add information to a noun (e.g., "The car **that I bought**"). In Vietnamese, we can often just place the describing phrase directly after the noun, or use the word **mà** to link them.

### Direct Modification

Just like an adjective comes after a noun, a whole action phrase can come after a noun.

<pre>
Người <b>tôi gặp hôm qua</b> là bác sĩ.
“The person <b>(that) I met yesterday</b> is a doctor.”
</pre>

### Using **mà** as a Linker

If the describing phrase is long or you want to make it very clear, use **mà**. Think of it as "that" or "which."

<pre>
Cuốn sách <b>mà tôi đang đọc</b> rất hay.
“The book <b>that I am reading</b> is very good.”
</pre>

### Identifying the Noun

The key is to notice the "Noun + [Description]" structure. Everything after the noun is just details about that specific noun.

### Examples

<pre>
Món ăn <b>mẹ nấu</b> là ngon nhất.
“The dish <b>Mom cooked</b> is the best.”
</pre>

<pre>
Ngôi nhà <b>mà họ đang ở</b> rất to.
“The house <b>that they are living in</b> is very big.”
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi thích chiếc xe <b>bạn mới mua</b>.
“I like the car <b>you just bought</b>.”
</pre>

<pre>
Đây là bí mật <b>mà không ai biết</b>.
“This is the secret <b>that no one knows</b>.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

In many cases, **mà** is optional. However, if the sentence feels complex, adding **mà** helps the listener separate the "thing" from the "details." You will also see this used for people (who) and places (where). As you immersion, try to "group" the noun and its description together as one single unit in your mind.
