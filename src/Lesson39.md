# Lesson 39: Relative-clause-like noun modification

Vietnamese does not use complex relative pronouns like "who," "which," or "that" in the same way English does.

### Direct Attachment

Often, you simply place the description right after the noun.

<pre>
Người <b>tôi gặp</b>.
"The person <b>(that) I met</b>."
</pre>

### The "that" Marker "mà"

You can use **mà** as a linker to clarify the description, especially if it's long.

<pre>
Cái áo <b>mà</b> tôi thích.
"The shirt <b>that</b> I like."
</pre>

### Identifying vs. Describing

The phrase after the noun narrows down *which* specific thing you mean.

<pre>
Món ăn <b>mẹ nấu</b>.
"The dish <b>(that) Mom cooked</b>."
</pre>

### One Conceptual Unit

Treat the "Noun + Description" as a single block.

<pre>
[Ngôi nhà <b>màu xanh</b>] đẹp.
"[The house <b>(that is) blue</b>] is beautiful."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Việc <b>bạn làm</b> rất tốt.
"The work <b>(that) you did</b> is very good."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Start by trying to drop the "who" or "that." Just say "The man [I saw]" (Người tôi thấy). Only add **mà** if the sentence feels crowded or confusing.
