# Lesson 34: Condition with “nếu”

To talk about things that _might_ happen, Vietnamese uses the word **nếu** (if). Just like the "Because... so..." pattern, Vietnamese has a very common "If... then..." pattern.

### The "If... Then..." Pattern (**Nếu ... thì ...**)

In Vietnamese, if you start a sentence with **nếu**, you almost always use **thì** to introduce the result. Even though English often drops the "then," Vietnamese keeps it to make the logic clear.

<pre>
<b>Nếu</b> ngày mai mưa <b>thì</b> tôi ở nhà.
“<b>If</b> it rains tomorrow, <b>(then)</b> I’ll stay home.”
</pre>

### Hypothetical "If" (**nếu như**)

If you want to emphasize that something is a "what if" scenario or a bit more hypothetical, you can use **nếu như**.

<pre>
<b>Nếu như</b> tôi là bạn, tôi sẽ không làm thế.
“<b>If</b> I were you, I wouldn't do that.”
</pre>

### Omitting "Nếu"

In casual speech, Vietnamese speakers sometimes drop **nếu** and just use **thì** to show the condition. The context makes the "if" part obvious.

<pre>
Thích <b>thì</b> mua đi!
“(If you) like (it), <b>then</b> buy (it)!”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
<b>Nếu</b> có thời gian <b>thì</b> mình đi cà phê nhé?
“<b>If</b> (we) have time, <b>then</b> let's go for coffee, okay?”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Nếu</b> bạn cần giúp đỡ <b>thì</b> cứ gọi tôi.
“<b>If</b> you need help, <b>then</b> just call me.”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Nếu như</b> không có anh, em không biết làm sao.
“<b>If</b> it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to do.”
</pre>

<pre>
Đắt quá <b>thì</b> không mua.
“(If it's) too expensive, <b>then</b> (I) won't buy (it).”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

The word **thì** is incredibly common and versatile. While it means "then" in an "if" sentence, it can also act as a topic marker (like "as for..."). For now, just focus on the **Nếu ... thì ...** pair. It’s like a set of bookends that holds your conditional thoughts together.
