# Lesson 34: Condition with “nếu”

To talk about hypothetical situations ("if"), Vietnamese uses the **nếu... thì...** pattern.

### The Conditional Frame

Just like "Because... so...", the "If... then..." pattern is a fixed pair: **Nếu [Condition], thì [Result]**.

<pre>
<b>Nếu</b> trời mưa <b>thì</b> tôi ở nhà.
"<b>If</b> it rains, <b>then</b> I stay home."
</pre>

### Strong Hypotheticals with "nếu như"

**Nếu như** adds a "what if" flavor, often effectively emphasizing the condition.

<pre>
<b>Nếu như</b> tôi là bạn...
"<b>If</b> I were you..."
</pre>

### Short-hand Conditions

In conversation, you can drop **nếu** and just use **thì** to imply the "if."

<pre>
Thích <b>thì</b> mua đi!
"(If you) like (it), <b>then</b> buy (it)!"
</pre>

### Future Possibilities

These markers anchor thoughts about things that haven't happened yet.

<pre>
<b>Nếu</b> rảnh <b>thì</b> đi cà phê.
"<b>If</b> free, <b>then</b> go for coffee."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
<b>Nếu</b> cần giúp <b>thì</b> gọi tôi.
"<b>If</b> need help, <b>then</b> call me."
</pre>

<pre>
Đắt quá <b>thì</b> thôi.
"(If it's) too expensive, <b>then</b> never mind."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Thì** is a powerful little word. In this context, it acts as the bridge that says "then this happens." Even if you don't say **nếu**, saying **thì** makes the listener understand that the first part was a condition.
