# Lesson 35: Purpose with “để”


**1\. "Để" and "Cho" to Indicate Purposes**
-------------------------------------------

Like many Vietnamese words, "**Để**" and "**Cho**" have lots of meanings and thus can confuse learners.

In the scope of this lesson, we focus on their use to indicate purposes.

### **Purpose of an Object**

In terms of meaning:

**để = in order to cho = for**

In terms of structure:

**để + verb cho + noun**

So when we want to talk about the use or purpose of an object, we can form the structures:

-   Object + **(dùng) để** + purpose
-   Object + dùng **cho việc** + purpose

Examples:

-   Bút dùng **để** viết. = Bút **để** viết. = Bút dùng **cho việc** viết bài.\
    (A pen is used to write/used for writing.)
-   TV dùng **để** xem phim. = TV **để** xem phim. = TV dùng **cho việc** xem phim.\
    (The TV is used to watch films/used for watching films.)

### **Purpose of an Action**

To talk about the purpose of an action, "**để**" is a more suitable option:

-   Tôi mua xe **để** đi lại cho dễ. = I bought a car in order to get around more easily.
-   Tôi học chăm **để** được điểm cao. = I study hard in order to get good grades.

* Notes: Can we use "**cho**" for an action? Yes, but not to describe the purpose. "**Cho**" can be used to indicate the target of the action:

-   Bạn lấy cho tôi cái bút. = Can you get me a pen?
-   Hùng đọc bài này cho thầy. = Hung, can you read this for me?
-   Cậu đưa cái này cho anh ấy. = Can you give this to him?
