# Lesson 16: Completed vs ongoing actions

Vietnamese sharply distinguishes between an action that is currently happening and one that has reached a result.

### Focusing on the Result with "xong"

The word **xong** indicates "finished" or "done." Placing **xong** after a verb emphasizes that the task is completed.

<pre>
Tôi ăn <b>xong</b> rồi.
"I (am) <b>finished</b> eating already."
</pre>

<pre>
Đọc <b>xong</b> cuốn sách này.
"<b>Finished</b> reading this book."
</pre>

### Continuous States with "vẫn"

To say that something is *still* happening and hasn't ended, use **vẫn** (or **vẫn đang**) before the verb.

<pre>
Trời <b>vẫn đang</b> mưa.
"It is <b>still</b> raining."
</pre>

<pre>
Họ <b>vẫn</b> làm việc.
"They <b>still</b> work."
</pre>

### Checking Status

A very common daily phrase is **Xong chưa?** (Done yet?).

<pre>
Học <b>xong chưa</b>?
"Finished studying <b>yet</b>?"
</pre>

### Process vs. Climax

Notice the logic:
- **Đang** (Process): In the middle of doing it.
- **Xong** (Climax): The moment it is done.

<pre>
Em <b>đang</b> viết thư. (Process)
"I <b>am</b> writing a letter."
</pre>

<pre>
Viết <b>xong</b> chưa? (Result check)
"Finished writing yet?"
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>vẫn</b> chờ.
"He is <b>still</b> waiting."
</pre>

<pre>
Chưa làm <b>xong</b>.
"Not finished yet."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Xong** implies a specific task or action is effectively over. It is very satisfying to use. Contrast this with **rồi** (already), which just marks a change. You often hear them together: **Xong rồi** (It's done already!).
