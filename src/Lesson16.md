# Lesson 16: Completed vs ongoing actions

Building on the last lesson, Vietnamese makes a very clear distinction between whether an action is a work-in-progress or a finished result.

### Completion with **xong**

While **rồi** means "already," the word **xong** specifically means "finished" or "done." Placing **xong** after a verb is the best way to show that a task is complete.

<pre>
Tôi ăn <b>xong</b> rồi.
“I am <b>finished</b> eating already.”
</pre>

Compare this to:

<pre>
Tôi <b>đang</b> ăn.
“I <b>am</b> eating (right now).”
</pre>

### The "Still" Action: **vẫn** and **vẫn đang**

If you want to emphasize that something is _still_ happening and hasn't finished yet, use **vẫn** or **vẫn đang** before the verb.

<pre>
Trời <b>vẫn đang</b> mưa.
“It is <b>still</b> raining.”
</pre>

### Result vs. Process

Notice how Vietnamese often pairs words to be precise.

- **Đang làm**: Doing it (process).
- **Làm xong**: Finished doing it (result).
- **Chưa làm xong**: Not finished yet (incomplete process).

### Examples

<pre>
Học <b>xong</b> chưa?
“Finished studying yet?”
</pre>

<pre>
Em <b>đang</b> viết thư.
“I’<b>m</b> writing a letter.”
</pre>

<pre>
Họ <b>vẫn</b> làm việc ở đó.
“They <b>still</b> work there.”
</pre>

<pre>
Đọc <b>xong</b> cuốn sách này rồi.
“(I) have <b>finished</b> reading this book already.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

You'll see **xong** used for everything from finishing a meal to finishing a project. It’s a very satisfying word to use! When you say **đang**, you are inviting the listener into the moment. When you say **xong**, you are moving the conversation past that action. Pay attention to how often people check in with "Xong chưa?" (Done yet?) in daily life.
