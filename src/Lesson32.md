# Lesson 32: Cause and reason (vì, tại, do)

When explaining _why_ something happened, Vietnamese uses **vì**, **tại**, and **do**. These words help you link a cause to its effect.

### Because (**vì**)

This is the most common, neutral word for "because." It is almost always paired with **nên** (so) in the second half of the sentence.

<pre>
<b>Vì</b> trời mưa <b>nên</b> tôi ở nhà.
“<b>Because</b> it rained, <b>(so)</b> I stayed home.”
</pre>

### Blaming or Negative Reason (**tại**)

Use **tại** when the reason is a mistake or something negative. It’s like saying "it's because of... (and it's bad)."

<pre>
<b>Tại</b> anh <b>nên</b> chúng ta bị muộn!
“<b>Because of</b> you, we are late!”
</pre>

### Formal or Neutral Cause (**do**)

The word **do** is often used in more formal context or for neutral scientific/logical reasons.

<pre>
Tai nạn <b>do</b> bất cẩn.
“The accident was <b>due to</b> carelessness.”
</pre>

### The "Because... So..." Pattern

It is very natural in Vietnamese to state both the cause and the result using the **Vì ... nên ...** structure. Even if English only uses one ("Because it rained, I stayed home"), Vietnamese likes to have both markers.

### Examples

<pre>
<b>Vì</b> mệt <b>nên</b> em đi ngủ sớm.
“<b>Because</b> (I'm) tired, <b>so</b> I'm going to sleep early.”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Tại</b> tắc đường <b>nên</b> tôi đến trễ.
“<b>Because of</b> a traffic jam, <b>so</b> I arrived late.”
</pre>

<pre>
Mọi việc đều <b>do</b> bạn quyết định.
“Everything is <b>due to (up to)</b> your decision.”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Vì</b> thích tiếng Việt <b>nên</b> tôi học mỗi ngày.
“<b>Because</b> (I) like Vietnamese, <b>so</b> I study every day.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Be careful with **tại**. If you use it with a person, it can sound like you are accusing them! If you want to be polite, stick with **vì**. As you listen to Vietnamese speakers, notice how they almost always follow a "why" sentence with **nên**. It creates a very clear logical flow that makes the language easy to follow.
