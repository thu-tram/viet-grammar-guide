# Lesson 40: Emphasis and fronting

To emphasize something, move it to the front.

### Framing with "thì"

Pull a topic to the front and add **thì** to say "As for X..."

<pre>
Cá <b>thì</b> tôi thích.
"Fish, <b>(topic marker)</b> I like."
</pre>

### Topic Displacement

You can freely move an object to the start to make it the focus.

<pre>
<b>Việc đó</b> tôi biết.
"<b>That matter</b>, I know."
</pre>

### Precision with "chính"

**Chính** means "exactly" or "the very one."

<pre>
<b>Chính</b> là anh ấy!
"It is <b>exactly</b> him!"
</pre>

### Inclusion with "cả"

**Cả** means "even" (including the extreme).

<pre>
Quên <b>cả</b> tên.
"Forgot <b>even</b> the name."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
<b>Hôm nay thì</b> bận.
"<b>As for today</b>, (I am) busy."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Fronting makes your Vietnamese sound very natural. Instead of "I don't like meat," try "Meat, I don't like" (Thịt thì tôi không thích). It sets the context immediately.
