# Lesson 40: Emphasis and fronting

Vietnamese is very flexible with word order when you want to emphasize a specific part of your sentence. By moving a word to the front (fronting), you are telling the listener: "This is what I am really talking about right now."

### Topic Fronting with **thì**

The most common way to emphasize a topic is to pull it to the very front and follow it with the word **thì**.

<pre>
Cá <b>thì</b> tôi thích, nhưng thịt <b>thì</b> không.
“(As for) fish, I like (it), but (as for) meat, I don't.”
</pre>

### Emphasizing the Subject or Object

You can move almost anything to the front to make it the center of attention.

<pre>
<b>Việc đó</b> tôi làm được.
“<b>That task</b>, I can do.” (Instead of "I can do that task.")
</pre>

### Using **chính** for Precision

To say "precisely" or "the very one," use **chính** before the noun.

<pre>
<b>Chính là</b> anh ấy!
“It is <b>exactly</b> him!”
</pre>

### Using **cả** for "Even"

To emphasize that something includes even the most unlikely things, use **cả**.

<pre>
Tôi ăn <b>cả</b> ớt nữa.
“I eat <b>even</b> chili too.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
<b>Hôm nay thì</b> tôi rảnh.
“<b>As for today</b>, I am free.”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Tiếng Việt thì</b> khó, nhưng vui.
“<b>As for Vietnamese</b>, (it) is hard, but fun.”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Chính tôi</b> đã thấy việc đó.
“<b>Exactly I (I myself)</b> saw that.”
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy quên <b>cả</b> tên tôi.
“He <b>even</b> forgot my name.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Fronting is what makes Vietnamese feel "topic-comment" (revisiting Lesson 1!). It allows you to set the stage before you give the information. **Thì** is like a little pause that says "About this thing..." As you listen to native speakers, you'll see they front things constantly to keep the conversation focused on the most important information.
