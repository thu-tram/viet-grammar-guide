# Lesson 25: Giving and receiving (cho, đưa, nhận)

Transactions in Vietnamese—giving things, taking things, or handing things over—center around three main verbs: **cho**, **đưa**, and **nhận**.

### To Give (**cho**)

The word **cho** is the general word for "to give." It can be a gift, an item, or even information.

<pre>
Bố <b>cho</b> con tiền.
“Father <b>gives</b> me money.”
</pre>

### To Hand Over (**đưa**)

If you are passing something to someone or handing it across a table, use **đưa**. It implies a more physical, direct transfer.

<pre>
Làm ơn <b>đưa</b> tôi cái chén.
“Please <b>hand</b> me the bowl.”
</pre>

### To Receive (**nhận**)

To get, receive, or accept something, use **nhận**.

<pre>
Tôi đã <b>nhận</b> được quà.
“I (successfully) <b>received</b> the gift.”
</pre>

### The Gift Pattern

Usually, you can either say **Giver + cho + Recipient + Thing** or **Giver + Thing + cho + Recipient**. Both are common!

<pre>
Tặng hoa <b>cho</b> bạn.
“(I) give flowers <b>to</b> (my) friend.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Chị <b>cho</b> em mượn sách nhé?
“Can you <b>give</b> (let) me borrow the book?”
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>đưa</b> mẹ đi bệnh viện.
“He <b>takes</b> (brings) Mom to the hospital.”
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn có <b>nhận</b> ra tôi không?
“Do you <b>receive</b> (recognize) me?”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Cho</b> tôi một ly cà phê đen.
“<b>Give</b> me a glass of black coffee.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Cho** is one of the most useful words in Vietnamese. You'll see it used for "giving" permission, "giving" a favor, or even "giving" a chance. **Đưa** can also mean "to take someone somewhere" (like taking a child to school). Start noticing which word people use based on whether they are handing something over physically or giving it as a gesture.
