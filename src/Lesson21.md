# Lesson 21: Comparison with “hơn”, “bằng”, “nhất”

To compare things in Vietnamese, you don't need to change the endings of adjectives (like "tall" to "taller"). Instead, you just add a comparison word after the adjective.

### More than (**hơn**)

To say something is "more [adjective]" than something else, use **hơn**.

<pre>
Anh <b>cao hơn</b> tôi.
“He is <b>taller than</b> me. (He <b>tall more (than)</b> me.)”
</pre>

### The Most (**nhất**)

To say something is the "most [adjective]," add **nhất** to the end.

<pre>
Món này <b>ngon nhất</b>.
“This dish is <b>the most delicious</b>.”
</pre>

### As... as (**bằng**)

To say two things are equal in a certain quality, use **bằng**.

<pre>
Tôi chạy <b>nhanh bằng</b> anh ấy.
“I run <b>as fast as</b> him.”
</pre>

### Omitting the second item

If it's already clear what you're comparing to, you can just stop after the comparison word.

<pre>
Cái này <b>đẹp hơn</b>.
“This one is <b>prettier (more beautiful)</b>.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Tiếng Việt <b>khó hơn</b> tiếng Anh không?
“Is Vietnamese <b>harder than</b> English?”
</pre>

<pre>
Hôm nay <b>nóng hơn</b> hôm qua.
“Today is <b>hotter than</b> yesterday.”
</pre>

<pre>
Ai là người <b>giỏi nhất</b>?
“Who is the <b>best (most talented)</b>?”
</pre>

<pre>
Nhà tôi <b>to bằng</b> nhà bạn.
“My house is <b>as big as</b> your house.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Notice that **hơn** can also be used with verbs to mean "more." For example, **thích hơn** means "like more" or "prefer." The word **nhất** is very versatile—you can combine it with almost any quality to show it's at the top of its class. Listen for how people use **nhất** to give high praise (or strong criticism!).
