# Lesson 12: Question words and placement

In Vietnamese, question words like "who," "what," "where," and "when" usually stay in the exact same spot where the answer would go. You don't need to move words to the front of the sentence like you do in English ("What are you eating?"). Instead, you just replace the piece of information you're asking about with the question word.

### Common Question Words

- **ai**: who
- **gì**: what
- **đâu**: where
- **nào**: which
- **bao giờ / khi nào**: when

### The "Answer Position" Pattern

Think of a sentence like a fill-in-the-blank puzzle.

<pre>
Bạn ăn <b>phở</b>. (You eat pho.)
Bạn ăn <b>gì</b>? (You eat <b>what</b>?)
</pre>

Notice how **gì** stays at the end, just like **phở**.

<pre>
Anh ấy là <b>Nam</b>. (He is Nam.)
Anh ấy là <b>ai</b>? (He is <b>who</b>?)
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Chị đi <b>đâu</b>?
“<b>Where</b> are you going?”
</pre>

<pre>
Cái <b>nào</b> đẹp?
“<b>Which</b> one is beautiful?”
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Bao giờ</b> anh về?
“<b>When</b> are you returning?”
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn làm nghề <b>gì</b>?
“<b>What</b> is your job? (You do <b>what</b> profession?)”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Because question words stay in place, Vietnamese sentences feel very consistent. You don't have to "gear up" for a question by changing the grammar at the start. One small thing to notice: **bao giờ** is often used for the future, while **khi nào** can be used for both past and future. You will naturally start to pick up these distinctions as you hear them in context.
