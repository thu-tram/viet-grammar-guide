# Lesson 12: Question words and placement

In Vietnamese, question words generally stay in the exact same spot where the answer would go. You don't need to move words to the front of the sentence.

### Static Question Words

Common question words include **ai** (who), **gì** (what), **đâu** (where), and **khi nào** (when). Notice how they sit in the sentence exactly where the information is missing.

### Replacing with "ai" or "gì"

To ask "who" or "what," simply swap the person or thing with the question word.

<pre>
Anh ấy là <b>Nam</b>. (He is Nam.)
Anh ấy là <b>ai</b>? (He is <b>who</b>?)
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn ăn <b>phở</b>. (You eat pho.)
Bạn ăn <b>gì</b>? (You eat <b>what</b>?)
</pre>

### Placement for "Where" and "When"

The words **đâu** (where) and **bao giờ** (when) also stay in their logical positions.

<pre>
Chị đi <b>đâu</b>?
"You are going <b>where</b>?"
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Bao giờ</b> anh về?
"<b>When</b> are you returning?"
</pre>

### No Inversion

Unlike English, which rearranges sentences to form questions ("What are you doing?"), Vietnamese never inverts the order.

<pre>
Bạn làm nghề <b>gì</b>?
"You do <b>what</b> profession?"
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Cái <b>nào</b> đẹp?
"<b>Which</b> one (is) beautiful?"
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Ai</b> nấu cơm?
"<b>Who</b> cooks?"
</pre>

<pre>
Sách của tôi ở <b>đâu</b>?
"My book is <b>where</b>?"
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Because question words stay in place, Vietnamese grammar feels very consistent. You don't have to "gear up" for a question by changing the start of the sentence. Just speak the sentence as a fact, but insert the "unknown" word where the answer belongs.
