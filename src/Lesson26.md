# Lesson 26: Benefactive constructions (làm cho ai)

Building on the previous lesson, the word **cho** isn't just for giving physical objects. It is also used to show that an action is being done _for_ someone’s benefit. This is often called a benefactive construction.

### Doing an Action "For" Someone

The pattern is: **Subject + Verb + (Object) + cho + Person**.

<pre>
Mẹ nấu cơm <b>cho</b> con.
“Mom cooks rice <b>for</b> me.”
</pre>

You aren’t giving the "rice" to the person in a literal transaction; you are performing the "cooking" for their sake.

### Providing Information

You also use **cho** when telling or explaining something to someone.

<pre>
Nói <b>cho</b> tôi biết.
“Tell <b>(for)</b> me know. (Tell me.)”
</pre>

### Making Something Happen

Sometimes, **cho** is used to mean "let" or "allow" something to happen.

<pre>
Để <b>cho</b> em làm.
“Let <b>(for)</b> me do it.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh mua hoa <b>cho</b> vợ.
“He buys flowers <b>for</b> (his) wife.”
</pre>

<pre>
Chị viết thư <b>cho</b> bạn nhé?
“Are you writing a letter <b>for/to</b> your friend?”
</pre>

<pre>
Hãy làm <b>cho</b> tôi một việc.
“Please do a favor <b>for</b> me.”
</pre>

<pre>
Giải thích <b>cho</b> tôi hiểu với.
“Explain it <b>(for)</b> me to understand.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

In English, we use "to," "for," or "at" depending on the verb ("talk _to_ me," "do it _for_ me"). In Vietnamese, **cho** covers almost all of these situations when someone else benefits from the action. It makes the language very consistent. As you listen, notice how **cho** acts as a bridge between the action and the person who is being helped.
