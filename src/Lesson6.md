# Lesson 6: Modifying nouns with adjectives and verb phrases

Understanding Vietnamese adjective placement is crucial for clear communication. Unlike English, where adjectives typically come before nouns, Vietnamese follows different rules. Once you internalize these patterns, basic Vietnamese adjectives will flow naturally in your sentences.

### Attributive placement after nouns

When an adjective directly describes a noun, it comes after that noun -- the opposite of English word order. Think of it as naming the thing first, then adding its quality. This pattern applies to all attributive adjectives without exception.

-   *áo đỏ* (red shirt) -- literally "shirt red"

-   *người cao* (tall person) -- literally "person tall"

### Predicative placement without linking verbs

When making a statement about a subject, the adjective follows the subject directly without any linking verb. The adjective itself carries the meaning of "being" that quality. This structure feels strange at first but becomes intuitive with practice.

-   *Món này ngon* (This dish is delicious) -- literally "Dish this delicious"

-   *Em bé buồn* (The baby is sad) -- literally "Baby sad"

### Order of multiple adjectives

When stacking multiple adjectives, Vietnamese follows a general sequence. While this order has some flexibility, following it produces the most natural-sounding sentences:

1.  Size: *to* (big), *nhỏ* (small)

2.  Shape: *tròn* (round), *vuông* (square)

3.  Quality: *đẹp* (beautiful), *tốt* (good)

4.  Color: *đỏ* (red), *xanh* (blue/green)

5.
