# Lesson 11: Yes–no questions

Creating a yes–no question in Vietnamese is often as simple as adding a question word to the end of a regular statement. You do not need to change the word order or use helper verbs.

### Ending with "không"

The most common way to turn a statement into a question is to add **không** at the end.

<pre>
Bạn đói <b>không</b>?
"Are you hungry?"
</pre>

<pre>
Em hiểu <b>không</b>?
"Do you understand?"
</pre>

### The "Có... không?" Frame

You might also see the pattern **có ... không**. This makes the question slightly more formal or explicit, but the meaning remains the same.

<pre>
Bạn <b>có</b> đói <b>không</b>?
"Are you hungry?"
</pre>

<pre>
Chị <b>có</b> mệt <b>không</b>?
"Are you tired?"
</pre>

### Checking Completion with "chưa"

When asking if something has happened *yet*, use **chưa** at the end instead of **không**.

<pre>
Anh ăn cơm <b>chưa</b>?
"Have you eaten <b>yet</b>?"
</pre>

<pre>
Trời mưa <b>chưa</b>?
"Has it rained <b>yet</b>?"
</pre>

### Verb-Based Responses

To answer, you usually repeat the verb or the adjective.
- To say "yes," repeat the verb or just say **có**.
- To say "no," say **không** or **chưa** followed by the verb.

<pre>
– Đi không? (Want to go?)
– <b>Đi</b>. (Yes.)
– <b>Không đi</b>. (No.)
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Phim hay <b>không</b>?
"Is the movie good?"
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn <b>có</b> xe <b>không</b>?
"Do you have a car?"
</pre>

<pre>
Học xong <b>chưa</b>?
"Finished studying <b>yet</b>?"
</pre>

### Note on flexibility

Vietnamese questions are very melodic. You’ll notice that the tone of your voice stays relatively steady, and the word at the end (**không** or **chưa**) does all the work of signaling that an answer is expected. As you listen, treat these words as simple "question markers."
