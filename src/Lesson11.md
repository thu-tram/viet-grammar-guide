# Lesson 11: Yes–no questions

Creating a yes–no question in Vietnamese is often as simple as adding a question word to the end of a regular statement. You don't need to change the word order or use helper verbs like "do" or "are."

### Using **không**

The most common way to ask a simple yes–no question is to add **không** at the end.

<pre>
Bạn đói không?
“Are you hungry?”
</pre>

You might also see the pattern **có ... không**. This makes the question slightly more formal or clear, but the meaning remains the same.

<pre>
Bạn có đói không?
“Are you hungry?”
</pre>

### Using **chưa**

When asking if something has happened _yet_, use **chưa** at the end instead of **không**.

<pre>
Anh ăn cơm chưa?
“Have you eaten yet?”
</pre>

This is one of the most common greetings in Vietnam. It’s more of a "How are you?" than a literal question about your meal.

### Responses

To answer, you usually repeat the verb or the adjective.

- To say "yes," you repeat the verb or just say **có**.
- To say "no," you say **không** or **chưa** followed by the verb.

<pre>
– Đi không? (Want to go?)
– Đi. (Yes / Going.)
– Không đi. (No / Not going.)
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Em hiểu không?
“Do you understand?”
</pre>

<pre>
Phim hay không?
“Is the movie good?”
</pre>

<pre>
Trời mưa chưa?
“Has it rained yet?”
</pre>

<pre>
Chị có mệt không?
“Are you tired?”
</pre>

### Note on flexibility

Vietnamese questions are very melodic. You’ll notice that the tone of your voice stays relatively steady, and the word at the end does all the work of turning the statement into a question. As you listen to more Vietnamese, you’ll hear how **không** and **chưa** act like little signals that an answer is expected.
