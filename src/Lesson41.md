# Lesson 41: Counting and classifiers

In Vietnamese, you generally cannot just put a number directly in front of a noun. You need a "classifier" in between to categorize the object.

### The Triple Pattern

The golden rule for counting is: **Number + Classifier + Noun**.

<pre>
Hai <b>con</b> mèo.
"Two <b>(animate)</b> cats."
</pre>

<pre>
Một <b>cái</b> bàn.
"One <b>(inanimate)</b> table."
</pre>

### Object Categories

Classifiers tell you about the nature of the object.
- **cái**: General inanimate objects (tables, chairs, bottles).
- **con**: Animals and children.
- **chiếc**: Vehicles (cars, bikes) and boats.
- **người**: People.

### Naming before Counting

The classifier acts as a unit of measure. Just as English says "two *loaves* of bread" or "two *sheets* of paper," Vietnamese requires this for almost everything.

<pre>
Ba <b>cuốn</b> sách.
"Three <b>(bound volumes)</b> books."
</pre>

### General vs. Specific

If you are talking about a category in general, you don't need the classifier. You only need it when counting or pointing at a specific item.

<pre>
Tôi thích <b>chó</b>. (General)
"I like dogs."
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi nuôi hai <b>con chó</b>. (Specific count)
"I raise two <b>(animal)</b> dogs."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Năm <b>người</b> bạn.
"Five <b>(people)</b> friends."
</pre>

<pre>
Bốn <b>tờ</b> giấy.
"Four <b>(sheets)</b> paper."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Cái** is the most common classifier for things, and **con** for animals. If you forget the specific classifier for a detailed object (like a blurry mental image), **cái** is often a safe backup for inanimate things.
