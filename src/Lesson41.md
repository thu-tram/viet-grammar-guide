# Lesson 41: Counting and classifiers

Counting in Vietnamese is different from English because almost every noun needs a "classifier"—a special word that describes the category of the object.

### The Counting Pattern

The standard structure is: **Number + Classifier + Noun**.

<pre>
<b>Hai con</b> mèo.
“<b>Two (animal classifier)</b> cats.”
</pre>

### Common Classifiers

- **con**: For animals and some active things (birds, rivers, knives).
- **cái**: For inanimate objects (chairs, tables, general things).
- **chiếc**: For vehicles, shoes, and some manufactured items.
- **cuốn / quyển**: For books and bound materials.
- **người / vị**: For people (vị is more respectful).
- **tờ**: For flat things like paper or tickets.

### When to omit classifiers

If you are talking about quantities in a general sense (like "I like cats" vs. "I have two cats"), you often don't need the classifier. You also usually don't need them with measurements (meters, kilos).

### Examples

<pre>
Tôi có <b>ba cuốn</b> sách.
“I have <b>three</b> books.”
</pre>

<pre>
Cho tôi <b>một cái</b> ghế.
“Give me <b>one</b> chair.”
</pre>

<pre>
Có <b>năm người</b> trong phòng.
“There are <b>five people</b> in the room.”
</pre>

<pre>
Mua <b>hai chiếc</b> xe máy.
“Buy <b>two</b> motorbikes.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Classifiers are the "soul" of Vietnamese nouns. They help the listener visualize the shape or nature of the object even before the noun is said. While it feels like a lot to learn, **cái** and **con** will cover a huge percentage of your daily needs. As you immersion, notice how nouns are almost never "naked" when they are being counted or pointed at!
