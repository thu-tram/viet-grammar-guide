# Lesson 17: Serial verb constructions (đi mua ăn, làm xong đi ngủ)

In Vietnamese, you can often string verbs or actions together in a row without using "to" or "and." This is called a **serial verb construction**. The meaning usually follows the order in which you say the words.

### Stringing Actions Together

If you are doing a series of related things, you just say them one after another.

<pre>
Tôi <b>đi mua cơm ăn</b>.
“I <b>go (to) buy rice (to) eat</b>.”
</pre>

Notice how English needs "to" twice, but Vietnamese just flows from one action to the next. The entire sequence is treated as one continuous event.

### Sequential Actions

You can also use this to show that one thing happens immediately after another. A very common pattern is using **xong** (finished) to bridge two actions.

<pre>
Làm <b>xong đi ngủ</b>.
“Finish work (and then) go to sleep.”
</pre>

### Verbs as Helpers

Some verbs like **đi** (go) or **đến** (come) often act as "helper" verbs that set the direction or intention of the main action.

<pre>
Anh <b>đi lấy</b> nước nhé?
“Shall I <b>go (and) get</b> some water?”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Mẹ <b>đi chợ mua</b> rau.
“Mom <b>goes to the market to buy</b> vegetables.”
</pre>

<pre>
Ăn <b>xong đi chơi</b>!
“Finish eating (and then) let's go out!”
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi <b>chạy ra mở</b> cửa.
“I <b>run out (to) open</b> the door.”
</pre>

<pre>
Em <b>về nhà lấy</b> đồ.
“I’m <b>going home (to) get</b> my things.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

This pattern makes Vietnamese feel very "fast" and direct. Instead of building a complex sentence with lots of connectors, you just list the actions as they occur in your mind. As you immerse, you'll start to recognize common "stacks" of verbs that always go together, like **đi mua** (go buy) or **đem về** (bring back).
