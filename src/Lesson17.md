# Lesson 17: Serial verb constructions

In Vietnamese, you can often string verbs or actions together in a continuous flow without needing words like "to" or "and."

### Flowing Actions

If you are doing a series of related things, you just list them in the order they happen.

<pre>
Tôi <b>đi mua cơm ăn</b>.
"I <b>go (to) buy rice (to) eat</b>."
</pre>

### Verb Stacking

You'll see common combinations that act as a single idea, like **đi mua** (go buy) or **về nhà** (go home).

<pre>
Mẹ <b>đi chợ mua</b> rau.
"Mom <b>goes to market</b> (to) <b>buy</b> vegetables."
</pre>

### Bridging with "xong"

Use **xong** (finished) to link one action ending and the next beginning immediately.

<pre>
Làm <b>xong đi ngủ</b>.
"Finish work (and then) <b>go to sleep</b>."
</pre>

<pre>
Ăn <b>xong đi chơi</b>!
"Finish eating (and then) <b>let's go out</b>!"
</pre>

### Intention through Motion

Movement verbs like **đi** (go) or **đến** (come) often act as helper verbs that set the direction for the main action.

<pre>
Anh <b>đi lấy</b> nước nhé?
"Shall I <b>go (and) get</b> water?"
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi <b>chạy ra mở</b> cửa.
"I <b>run out (to) open</b> the door."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Em <b>về nhà lấy</b> đồ.
"I'm <b>going home (to) get</b> my things."
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn <b>đi học về</b> chưa?
"Have you <b>gone to school (and) come back</b> yet?"
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi <b>ngồi đọc</b> sách.
"I <b>sit (and) read</b> a book."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

This pattern makes Vietnamese feel very direct and fast. Instead of building complex sentences with connectors, you just list the actions as they occur in your mind.
