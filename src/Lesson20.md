# Lesson 20: Degree words (rất, khá, hơi, quá, lắm)

Degree words help you talk about the intensity of a quality—whether something is "very" hot, "a bit" expensive, or "too" far. In Vietnamese, some of these words go before the adjective, and some go after.

### Words that go BEFORE the adjective

- **rất** (very): The standard, neutral way to say very.
  <pre>Rất đẹp. (Very beautiful.)</pre>
- **hơi** (a bit / somewhat): Used for slight intensity.
  <pre>Hơi đắt. (A bit expensive.)</pre>
- **khá** (quite / pretty):
  <pre>Khá tốt. (Quite good.)</pre>

### Words that go AFTER the adjective

- **lắm** (very / extremely): Much more casual and emphatic than _rất_.
  <pre>Đẹp lắm! (Very beautiful!)</pre>
- **quá** (too / so): Can mean "too much" or just "so much!"
  <pre>Nóng quá. (Too hot / So hot!)</pre>

### The "Too" vs. "Very" Distinction

While **quá** can mean "too," it is often used just to show excitement or strong feeling. If you want to be very clear that something is _excessively_ so, you might add **trời** or other markers, but usually, context does the work.

### Examples

<pre>
Món này <b>rất</b> ngon.
“This dish is <b>very</b> delicious.”
</pre>

<pre>
Hôm nay <b>hơi</b> lạnh nhỉ?
“It's <b>a bit</b> cold today, isn't it?”
</pre>

<pre>
Cái này đắt <b>quá</b>!
“This thing is <b>too</b> expensive!”
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy hiền <b>lắm</b>.
“He is <b>very</b> gentle/kind.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

You will hear **lắm** and **quá** much more often in spoken Vietnamese because they feel more emotional and expressive. **Rất** can sometimes sound a bit like a textbook if used too much in casual conversation. A great way to sound more natural is to use **quá** at the end of your adjectives when you are genuinely impressed or bothered by something!
