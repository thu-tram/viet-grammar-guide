# Lesson 20: Degree words (rất, khá, hơi, quá, lắm)

Degree words describe intensity—"very," "a bit," or "too." Vietnamese places some before the adjective and some after.

### Front-Loaded Intensity

These words appear **before** the adjective:
- **rất** (very)
- **hơi** (a bit / somewhat)
- **khá** (quite / pretty)

<pre>
Món này <b>rất</b> ngon.
"This dish is <b>very</b> delicious."
</pre>

<pre>
Hôm nay <b>hơi</b> lạnh.
"It's <b>a bit</b> cold today."
</pre>

### End-Loaded Emphasis

These words appear **after** the adjective for clearer emotional impact:
- **lắm** (very / extremely)
- **quá** (too / so!)

<pre>
Anh ấy hiền <b>lắm</b>.
"He is <b>very</b> gentle."
</pre>

<pre>
Cái này đắt <b>quá</b>!
"This thing is <b>too</b> expensive!"
</pre>

### Tone and Mood

**Lắm** feels more conversational than **rất**. **Quá** is often used to show excitement or strong feeling, similar to "so!" in English.

<pre>
Đẹp <b>lắm</b>! (Expressive)
<b>Rất</b> đẹp. (Neutral fact)
</pre>

### Excessive vs. Emphatic

While **quá** can mean "too much" (excessive), context usually clarifies whether you are complaining or just praising.

<pre>
Nóng <b>quá</b>!
"<b>So</b> hot!" (or "Too hot!")
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Bài này <b>hơi</b> khó.
"This lesson is <b>a bit</b> difficult."
</pre>

<pre>
Trời đẹp <b>quá</b> nhỉ?
"The weather is <b>so</b> beautiful, isn't it?"
</pre>

<pre>
Khá <b>tốt</b>.
"Quite <b>good</b>."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Using **quá** at the end of an adjective is a great way to sound authentic when you are impressed or reacting to something in the moment.
