# Lesson 24: Arrival, departure, and destination

Building on our movement verbs, we need to know how to talk about reaching our destination or starting our journey. The key words here are **đi**, **đến**, **tới**, and **từ**.

### Leaving and Going (**đi**)

While **đi** can mean the act of walking or going, it also implies the act of departing or leaving.

<pre>
Tôi <b>đi</b> sân bay.
“I am <b>going</b> (to) the airport.”
</pre>

### Reaching the Destination (**đến / tới**)

Both **đến** and **tới** mean "to arrive" or "to reach." You use them to emphasize that you have finished the trip or are targeting a specific spot.

<pre>
Bao giờ bạn <b>đến</b>?
“When will you <b>arrive</b>?”
</pre>

<pre>
Đi <b>tới</b> cuối đường.
“Go <b>until/to</b> the end of the road.”
</pre>

### Origin and Destination: **từ ... đến/tới**

To say "from [Place A] to [Place B]," the pattern is simple and fixed.

<pre>
<b>Từ</b> nhà <b>đến</b> trường.
“<b>From</b> home <b>to</b> school.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy vừa <b>đi</b> rồi.
“He just <b>left</b> already.”
</pre>

<pre>
Chúng tôi đã <b>đến</b> nơi.
“We have <b>arrived</b> (at the place).”
</pre>

<pre>
Chuyến bay này <b>đi</b> từ Sài Gòn <b>đến</b> Bangkok.
“This flight <b>goes</b> from Saigon <b>to</b> Bangkok.”
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn đi <b>tới đâu</b> rồi?
“<b>Where</b> have you <b>reached</b> (so far)?”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Đến** and **tới** are often interchangeable, but **đến** is slightly more common for "arriving" at a physical place, while **tới** can also feel like "moving toward" something. You’ll also hear **đến** used when talking about time, like **đến giờ rồi** ("it's time already"). Pay attention to how these words act as landmarks in a sentence, signaling the beginning and end of a path.
