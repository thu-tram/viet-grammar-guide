# Lesson 24: Arrival, departure, and destination

Talking about travel involves clearly marking the start, the end, and the path in between.

### Initiating with "đi"

**Đi** means "to go," but it also functions as the marker for leaving or starting a journey.

<pre>
Tôi <b>đi</b> sân bay.
"I <b>go</b> to the airport."
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy vừa <b>đi</b> rồi.
"He just <b>left</b> already."
</pre>

### Concluding with "đến"

Use **đến** (or **tới**) to emphasize arrival or reaching a specific point.

<pre>
Chúng tôi đã <b>đến</b> nơi.
"We have <b>arrived</b> at the place."
</pre>

<pre>
Khi nào bạn <b>đến</b>?
"When will you <b>arrive</b>?"
</pre>

### Pathways with "từ... đến"

The standard structure for a route is **từ** (from) ... **đến** (to).

<pre>
Đi <b>từ</b> nhà <b>đến</b> trường.
"Go <b>from</b> home <b>to</b> school."
</pre>

<pre>
Chuyến bay <b>từ</b> Sài Gòn <b>đến</b> Bangkok.
"Flight <b>from</b> Saigon <b>to</b> Bangkok."
</pre>

### Time as a Destination

**Đến** is also used to show that a specific time has "arrived."

<pre>
<b>Đến</b> giờ rồi.
"<b>Arrived</b> (at the) hour already. (It's time.)"
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Bạn đi <b>tới đâu</b> rồi?
"<b>Where</b> have you <b>reached</b> (so far)?"
</pre>

<pre>
Đi <b>tới</b> cuối đường.
"Go <b>until/to</b> the end of the road."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Đến** and **tới** are often interchangeable, but **đến** feels slightly more like hitting a target, while **tới** can feel like moving toward it.
