# Lesson 30: Wanting and intending (muốn, định)

To talk about your desires and plans for the future, you will mostly use the words **muốn** (want) and **định** (intend).

### Desires (**muốn**)

Use **muốn** when you have a wish or a desire to do something.

<pre>
Tôi <b>muốn</b> uống cà phê.
“I <b>want</b> to drink coffee.”
</pre>

### Plans (**định**)

Use **định** when you have already thought about it and "plan" or "intend" to do it. It is stronger and more specific than just wanting.

<pre>
Cuối tuần này tôi <b>định</b> về quê.
“This weekend I <b>plan</b> to go back to my hometown.”
</pre>

### Liking as Wanting (**thích**)

Sometimes Vietnamese speakers use **thích** (like) where English speakers might say "I want." It sounds a bit softer and more preference-based.

<pre>
Bạn có <b>thích</b> đi xem phim không?
“Would you <b>like</b> to go see a movie?”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Em <b>muốn</b> mua cái áo này.
“I <b>want</b> to buy this shirt.”
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>định</b> mua nhà mới.
“He <b>intends</b> to buy a new house.”
</pre>

<pre>
Chúng tôi không <b>muốn</b> làm phiền bạn.
“We don't <b>want</b> to bother you.”
</pre>

<pre>
Hè này bạn <b>định</b> đi đâu?
“Where do you <b>plan</b> to go this summer?”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

The difference between **muốn** and **định** is the difference between a feeling and an action plan. You can **muốn** many things that you never actually **định** to do! One other word to look out for is **thèm**, which is a very strong "want" specifically for food cravings. For now, stick with **muốn** for general wishes and **định** for your upcoming schedule.
