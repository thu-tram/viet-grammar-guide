# Lesson 23: Direction and movement verbs

In Vietnamese, movement is very specific. Many verbs already have the "direction" built into them. Instead of just saying "go" + a preposition, you choose a specific verb that tells the listener exactly where you are heading.

### The Basic Directions

- **ra**: Outward (or toward the north, or toward a bigger city/main street).
- **vào**: Inward (or toward the south, or toward a smaller street/room).
- **lên**: Up (or toward the highlands/mountains).
- **xuống**: Down (or toward the delta/lowlands).
- **về**: Return (home, to your hometown, or to where you belong).

### Combining Movement

You can add these direction words after a main action verb to show _how_ and _where_ someone is moving.

<pre>
Chạy <b>ra</b>. (Run <b>out</b>.)
Đi <b>vào</b>. (Walk <b>in</b>.)
Nhìn <b>lên</b>. (Look <b>up</b>.)
</pre>

### Returning Home (**về**)

One of the most important cultural nuances is **về**. You don't "go" (_đi_) home; you always "return" (_về_) home.

<pre>
Tôi <b>về</b> nhà.
“I’m going (returning) home.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy đi <b>ra</b> Hà Nội.
“He is going (out/up) to Hanoi.”
</pre>

<pre>
Mời bạn vào <b>trong</b> nhà.
“Please come <b>in</b> (into) the house.”
</pre>

<pre>
Chúng ta đi <b>lên</b> tầng hai nhé.
“Let's go <b>up</b> to the second floor.”
</pre>

<pre>
Khi nào bạn <b>về</b> quê?
“When are you <b>returning</b> to your hometown?”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

The choice between **ra/vào** or **lên/xuống** can sometimes feel tricky because it depends on your perspective. Generally, "ra" is toward the "outside" or "center of activity," while "vào" is toward the "inside" or "quiet area." As you immerse, you'll see that these words are used even for things like "logging in" (**đăng nhập vào**) or "turning on" the light. Just start by noticing the physical movement first.
