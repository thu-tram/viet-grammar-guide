# Lesson 23: Direction and movement verbs

In Vietnamese, movement is very specific. Many verbs have "direction" built into them, or use a directional suffix to show exactly where the action is headed.

### The Five Core Directions

- **ra**: Outward / North / To a busy place
- **vào**: Inward / South / To a quiet place
- **lên**: Up / To highlands
- **xuống**: Down / To lowlands / From a vehicle
- **về**: Return / Home

### Directional Suffixes

You attach these words to the end of action verbs to show the path of movement.

<pre>
Đi <b>lên</b>.
"Go <b>up</b>."
</pre>

<pre>
Nhìn <b>xuống</b>.
"Look <b>down</b>."
</pre>

<pre>
Chạy <b>ra</b> ngoài.
"Run <b>out</b> outside."
</pre>

### The Inward/Outward Perspective

The logic of **ra** and **vào** is perspective-based. Going from a small room to the street is **ra**. Going from the street into a house is **vào**.

<pre>
Mời bạn <b>vào</b> nhà.
"Please come <b>in</b> (to the house)."
</pre>

### Home as a Destination

When going to the place where you live or belong, you always use **về**.

<pre>
Tôi <b>về</b> nhà.
"I <b>return</b> home."
</pre>

<pre>
Bao giờ bạn <b>về</b> nước?
"When do you <b>return</b> to (your) country?"
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy đi <b>ra</b> Hà Nội.
"He is going <b>out</b> (north) to Hanoi."
</pre>

<pre>
Chúng ta đi <b>lên</b> tầng hai nhé.
"Let's go <b>up</b> to the second floor, okay?"
</pre>

### Note on nuance

This system is deeply ingrained. You rarely just "go" somewhere; you go "out," "in," "up," or "down" to it. Pay attention to how locals use **ra** and **vào** for things like "logging in" (**vào**) or "going out to eat" (**ra** quán).
