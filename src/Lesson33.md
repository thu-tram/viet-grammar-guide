# Lesson 33: Result and consequence (nên, cho nên, thành ra)

Following up on the "reason" words, we also have words that focus specifically on the **result** or the **consequence**.

### So (**nên / cho nên**)

**Nên** is the most common way to say "so." **Cho nên** is just a slightly longer, more formal version that adds a bit more weight to the result.

<pre>
Tôi bận <b>nên</b> không đi được.
“I'm busy, <b>so</b> I can't go.”
</pre>

### The Unexpected Result (**thành ra**)

The phrase **thành ra** is used when a result happens that you might not have planned or expected. It’s like saying "consequently," "and so it turned out that..." or "ended up."

<pre>
Trễ xe buýt <b>thành ra</b> tôi phải đi bộ.
“(I) missed the bus, <b>consequently</b> I had to walk.”
</pre>

### The Logic Flow

In Vietnamese, results are almost always clearly marked. While English might just use a comma, Vietnamese prefers to signaling the "therefore" moment with one of these words.

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy học rất giỏi <b>cho nên</b> được học bổng.
“He studied very well, <b>and so</b> he got a scholarship.”
</pre>

<pre>
Quên mang ô <b>thành ra</b> bị ướt hết.
“(I) forgot an umbrella, <b>so it turned out</b> (I) got all wet.”
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi thích ăn cay <b>nên</b> cho thêm nhiều ớt.
“I like eating spicy food, <b>so</b> I added more chili.”
</pre>

<pre>
Mọi người đều đồng ý <b>thành ra</b> việc này rất dễ.
“Everyone agreed, <b>consequently</b> this matter was very easy.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Thành ra** often carries a slightly resigned or casual tone. It's very common when recounting a story about how things went wrong or changed unexpectedly. **Nên** and **cho nên** are your reliable workhorses for everyday logic. Listening for these markers will help you map out the "cause and effect" in any Vietnamese conversation.
