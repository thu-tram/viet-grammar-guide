# Lesson 33: Result and consequence (nên, cho nên, thành ra)

Sometimes you want to focus specifically on the result or consequence of an action.

### Expected Results with "nên"

**Nên** is the standard marker for logical results ("so" / "therefore").

<pre>
Tôi bận <b>nên</b> không đi được.
"I'm busy, <b>so</b> I can't go."
</pre>

### Weighty Results with "cho nên"

**Cho nên** is a slightly heavier, more formal version of **nên**.

<pre>
Anh ấy học giỏi <b>cho nên</b> được học bổng.
"He studies well, <b>therefore</b> he got a scholarship."
</pre>

### Accidental Results with "thành ra"

**Thành ra** introduces a specific result that wasn't necessarily planned. It means "turned out that" or "consequently."

<pre>
Quên mang ô <b>thành ra</b> bị ướt.
"Forgot umbrella, <b>so it turned out</b> (I) got wet."
</pre>

### Storytelling Logic

These words build a narrative bridge: [Event A] -> [Connector] -> [Event B].

<pre>
Trời mưa to <b>thành ra</b> hủy chuyến đi.
"Rain was heavy, <b>consequently</b> canceled the trip."
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Thích ăn cay <b>nên</b> cho nhiều ớt.
"(I) like spicy eating, <b>so</b> (I) put lots of chili."
</pre>

<pre>
Xe hỏng <b>nên</b> phải đi bộ.
"Car broke, <b>so</b> had to walk."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

**Thành ra** often has a casual, storytelling vibe ("...and so I ended up..."). **Nên** is your everyday logic connector. Notice how they signal that the next part of the sentence is the "outcome."
