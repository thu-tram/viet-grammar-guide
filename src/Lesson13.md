# Lesson 13: Sentence-final particles (à, hả, nhé, nhỉ, ạ, etc.)


After reading a few language books about vietnamese, the first thing I recognized is the conversations in those books are all so weird. Vietnamese is a spoken and tonal language, therefore there's a major differences between what we write and what we speak. The most noticable thing to transform a phrase from writen to a system of words for oral communication I believe is the present of **"tình thái từ"** and **"thán từ"** -- (final) particles.\
**"Thán từ"** (interjection) is used to express emotions (a, ái, ơ, ôi, ô hay, trời ơi, ...) or for interaction (này , ơi , vâng , dạ ,..).

-   Those **"a", "á", "ơ", "ôi", "ô**" are similar to "oh" or "oops"

-   **"Trời ơi"** or **"ôi trời ơi**" simply mean "oh my god"

-   **"này"** and** "ơi"** both mean "hey" in English, although there is a slightly diffence:
-   **"Này"** is a "hey" in casual and low key converstions or used to talk with someone in the same social status with you (friend-friend). This will be disrespect if you call a senior like that. Eg: này bạn (bạn này), này cậu (cậu này),...

-   **"Ơi"** in the other hand is a "hey" but you can call use it to call pretty much everyone. Eg: ông ơi, bà ơi, bố ơi, mẹ ơi,...

"**Tình thái từ"**: words added in sentece to turn it into question, request or display emotions of speaker. There are 4 types.

-   Questionare: **à, ư, hả, hử, chứ, chăng, nhỉ, cơ, nhé,...**

Eg:  Anh Tuấn uống cà phê  (Tuấn drinks coffee) -> Anh Tuấn uống cà phê à/hả? ( Are you drinking coffee, Tuấn?)\
Anh Tuấn uống cà phê chứ/ nhé? (notice with "nhé" & "chứ" added, it sounds more like a suggetion: Tuấn, do you like to drink coffee?)

-   Order/request: **đi, nào, với, đi thôi, nhé,...**

Eg: Anh Tuấn uống cà phê  -> Anh Tuấn uống cà phê đi/nhé! (Tuan, let's drink coffee!)

-   Exclamation: **thay, sao, thật, quá, lắm...**

Eg: Cô ấy xinh (She's pretty) -> Cô ấy xinh lắm/quá! (She's pretty!)

-   Emotional expression (or politeness?): ạ, nhé, cơ, mà, dạ, vâng,...

-   **"Dạ", "ạ", "vâng"** are formal and very polite words, used to speak to seniors or people with higher social status than you.

-   Add **"ạ"** in the end of a sentence/answer to display an extreme respect. Eg: Con ăn cơm ạ!

-   **"Dạ"** and "vâng" mean "yes" in an extreme respect, usually added at the beginning of an answer. Eg: Dạ, con về rồi!\
*Note:* **"nhé"** is a convenience word which can be used in almost everywhere and very very often. It normally appears at the end of  a sentence, depends on your tone so that can be an answer, a question, a suggestion, etc.


Ending particle: ...+ nhỉ/ha
==========================

**Learn Vietnamese online: ...+ nhỉ/ha**

**Nhỉ/ ha are ending particles, used after a spoken word to express judgment:**

-- Đẹp nhỉ! (beautiful, isn't it?)\
-- Vui quá ha! (fun, isn't it?)\
-- Chán nhỉ!(boring, isn't it?)

**or indicate intimacy, gentle in the question:**

-- Anh ấy có đến không nhỉ? (Will he come?)\
-- Em có điện thoại không ha? (Do you have a phone?)

**Note:**

1\. NHỈ is used by Nothern people and HA is used by southern people.\
2\. Southern people also use HEN/HENG instead of HA.\
Cái váy này đẹp hen? (This dress is nice, isn't it?)\
Mua cái này heng?(How about buying this dress?)
