# Lesson 13: Sentence-final particles (à, hả, nhé, nhỉ, ạ, etc.)

Vietnamese is famous for its "flavor words"—small particles at the end of a sentence that don't change the basic meaning but add a specific mood, emotion, or level of politeness. These are called sentence-final particles.

### Adding Politeness with **ạ**

The word **ạ** is used at the very end of a sentence when speaking to someone older or in a position of respect. It doesn't mean anything on its own; it just shows you are being polite.

<pre>
Chào cô ạ.
“Hello (ma'am).”
</pre>

### Asking for Agreement with **nhé**

If you want to suggest something or make sure the other person is okay with a plan, use **nhé**. It's like saying "okay?" or "shall we?"

<pre>
Chúng ta đi nhé?
“Shall we go?”
</pre>

### Expressing Surprise or Realization with **à**

When you just realized something or want to confirm a fact with a bit of a "Oh, I see" feeling, use **à**.

<pre>
Anh là người Mỹ à?
“Oh, so you are American?”
</pre>

### Casual Questions with **hả**

This is a very common, informal way to turn a statement into a question, similar to "huh?" or "right?"

<pre>
Đẹp hả?
“It's beautiful, right? / Really?”
</pre>

### Thinking Out Loud with **nhỉ**

When you are making a comment about something and inviting the other person to agree, or just musing to yourself, use **nhỉ**.

<pre>
Hôm nay trời đẹp nhỉ?
“It's a beautiful day, isn't it?”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Con cảm ơn mẹ ạ.
“Thank you, Mom.”
</pre>

<pre>
Ăn cơm nhé!
“Let's eat!”
</pre>

<pre>
Em chưa biết à?
“You don't know yet? (Oh!)”
</pre>

<pre>
Nóng quá nhỉ?
“It's so hot, don't you think?”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

These particles are the "secret sauce" of natural Vietnamese. You don't need to master all of them at once. Just start noticing how they change the "music" of the conversation. **Ạ** is always safe to use for politeness, while **nhé** is great for being friendly. The best way to learn these is to listen to the tone of voice people use when they say them.
