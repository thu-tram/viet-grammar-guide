# Lesson 13: Sentence-final particles

Vietnamese uses small words called particles at the end of sentences to add mood, emotion, or politeness. They function like "flavor words" that shape how the sentence feels.

### Politeness with "ạ"

The particle **ạ** is used at the very end of a sentence to show respect to someone older or higher in status. It doesn't change the meaning, only the tone.

<pre>
Chào cô <b>ạ</b>.
"Hello (ma'am)."
</pre>

<pre>
Con cảm ơn mẹ <b>ạ</b>.
"Thank you, Mom."
</pre>

### Agreement with "nhé"

Use **nhé** to suggest something or check that the other person is okay with a plan. It translates roughly to "okay?" or "shall we?"

<pre>
Chúng ta đi <b>nhé</b>?
"Shall we go, <b>okay</b>?"
</pre>

<pre>
Ăn cơm <b>nhé</b>!
"Let's eat, <b>okay</b>!"
</pre>

### Confirmation with "à" and "hả"

**À** expresses realization or mild surprise.
<pre>
Anh là người Mỹ <b>à</b>?
"Oh, so you are American?"
</pre>

**Hả** is a casual way to convert a statement into a question, like "huh?" or "right?"
<pre>
Đẹp <b>hả</b>?
"It's beautiful, <b>right</b>?"
</pre>

### Shared Sentiment with "nhỉ"

Use **nhỉ** to invite the other person to agree with your observation, or when musing to yourself.

<pre>
Hôm nay trời đẹp <b>nhỉ</b>?
"It's a beautiful day, <b>isn't it</b>?"
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Em chưa biết <b>à</b>?
"You don't know yet? (Oh!)"
</pre>

<pre>
Nóng quá <b>nhỉ</b>?
"It's so hot, don't you think?"
</pre>

<pre>
Đi chơi <b>nhé</b>?
"Let's go out, okay?"
</pre>

### Note on nuance

These particles are the "secret sauce" of natural Vietnamese. **Ạ** is the safest one to use for politeness. **Nhé** is very friendly and common. Listen to the tone of voice people use with these words—that melody is part of the grammar.
