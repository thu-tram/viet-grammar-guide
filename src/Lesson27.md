# Lesson 27: Ability with “có thể”, “biết”

To say "can" in Vietnamese, you have to choose between two different meanings: whether you _know how_ to do something (a learned skill) or whether you are _physically able_ to do it (possibility).

### Learned Skills (**biết**)

Use **biết** before a verb when you have learned how to do that action. This is like saying "I know how to..."

<pre>
Tôi <b>biết</b> nói tiếng Việt.
“I <b>can</b> speak Vietnamese. (I <b>know</b> speak...)”
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn có <b>biết</b> bơi không?
“Do you <b>know (how)</b> to swim?”
</pre>

### General Possibility (**có thể**)

Use **có thể** before a verb for general ability, physical capability, or possibility.

<pre>
Tôi <b>có thể</b> đi bộ 10km.
“I <b>can</b> walk 10km.”
</pre>

### Ability as a Result (**được**)

Sometimes, you’ll see the word **được** at the end of a sentence. This also means "can," but it focuses on whether the result is achievable.

<pre>
Tôi làm <b>được</b>.
“I <b>can</b> do it. (I <b>successfully</b> do it.)”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>biết</b> lái xe.
“He <b>knows</b> how to drive.”
</pre>

<pre>
Hôm nay tôi <b>có thể</b> đến muộn.
“I <b>can</b> (might) arrive late today.”
</pre>

<pre>
Em không <b>biết</b> nấu ăn.
“I don't <b>know</b> how to cook.”
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn có ăn <b>được</b> ớt không?
“<b>Can</b> you eat chili? (Are you <b>able to handle</b> it?)”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

The difference between **biết** and **có thể** is quite important. If you say you **biết** eat spicy food, it sounds like eating spicy food is a skill you studied! Usually, for food or physical endurance, people use **được** (at the end) or **có thể**. As you immerse, you'll see **biết** used for languages, sports, and technical skills, while **có thể** is for circumstances.
