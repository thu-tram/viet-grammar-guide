# Lesson 18: Result verbs and complements

In Vietnamese, many actions are split into two parts: the **effort** (what you do) and the **result** (what actually happens). To show the result, we add a second "result verb" or "complement" right after the main verb.

### Effort vs. Result

Think about the difference between "looking" and actually "seeing." In Vietnamese, these are separate but linked.

- **Nhìn**: To look (the effort).
- **Nhìn thấy**: To see (the effort + the result of "finding" with your eyes).

Similarly for listening:

- **Nghe**: To listen.
- **Nghe thấy**: To hear (the result).

### Achieving Success with **được**

The word **được** is often used after a verb to show that you successfully achieved the goal of the action.

<pre>
Tôi mua <b>được</b> vé rồi.
“I (successfully) <b>bought</b> the ticket.”
</pre>

Without **được**, you might just be in the process of buying it. With **được**, it’s a done deal.

### Losing or Failing with **mất**

Conversely, **mất** is used when the result is negative or involves loss.

<pre>
Tôi quên <b>mất</b> rồi.
“I <b>forgot</b> (completely/sadly).”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Bạn có nhìn <b>thấy</b> con mèo không?
“Do you <b>see</b> the cat?”
</pre>

<pre>
Em tìm <b>được</b> chìa khóa rồi!
“I <b>found</b> the keys!”
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi nghe <b>thấy</b> tiếng chim hót.
“I <b>hear</b> the birds singing.”
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy đi <b>đâu mất</b> rồi.
“He <b>disappeared</b> somewhere (is gone).”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Using these result verbs makes your Vietnamese sound much more natural. It clarifies whether an action was successful or just attempted. You’ll notice **thấy** used with all the senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling). Just remember: the first verb is what you _try_ to do, and the second verb is what _happens_ because of it.
