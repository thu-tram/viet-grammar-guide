# Lesson 8: Existence with “có” and “không có”

In Vietnamese, the word **có** is incredibly versatile. While you might already know it as the word for "to have," it is also used to express existence—like "there is" or "there are" in English. When you want to say something doesn't exist or isn't there, you use **không có**.

The pattern for existence is quite simple and often follows a "Location + **có** + Thing" structure. You are essentially setting the scene and then stating what exists within it.

<pre>
Trong tủ lạnh có sữa.
“There is milk in the fridge.”
</pre>

If the location is already clear from the context, you can drop it entirely. Vietnamese relies heavily on what is already known, so you’ll often hear sentences that start directly with **có**.

<pre>
Có ai ở đó không?
“Is there anyone there?”
</pre>

To say something is missing or doesn't exist, just add **không** before **có**.

<pre>
Hôm nay không có nắng.
“There is no sun today.”
</pre>

One thing to notice is that Vietnamese doesn't distinguish between "having" something and "there being" something as strictly as English does. Whether a person possesses an item or a place contains an item, the word is still **có**.

### Examples

<pre>
Trên bàn có hai cuốn sách.
“There are two books on the table.”
</pre>

<pre>
Trong phòng này không có cửa sổ.
“There are no windows in this room.”
</pre>

<pre>
Có vấn đề gì không?
“Is there any problem?”
</pre>

<pre>
Ngày mai không có lớp học.
“There is no class tomorrow.”
</pre>

### Note on flexibility

The location can sometimes move around, or even be implied by a gesture. The focus is always on the existence of the object within the current context. You don't need to worry about plural versions of "there is"—**có** handles both singular and plural naturally.
