# Lesson 19: Adverbs and adverb placement

Adverbs are words that describe _how_ an action is done (like "quickly") or _how often_ it happens (like "often"). In Vietnamese, the position of the adverb depends on what kind of information it is giving.

### How an action is done (Manner)

Words that describe the quality of an action usually go **after** the verb.

<pre>
Anh ấy chạy <b>nhanh</b>.
“He runs <b>fast</b>.”
</pre>

<pre>
Em nói <b>chậm</b> thôi.
“Speak <b>slowly</b> please.”
</pre>

### How often it happens (Frequency)

Words describing frequency usually go **before** the verb, similar to English.

<pre>
Tôi <b>thường</b> đi bộ.
“I <b>often</b> walk.”
</pre>

<pre>
Họ <b>ít khi</b> ăn tối ở ngoài.
“They <b>rarely</b> eat out.”
</pre>

### Doubling for flavor (Reduplication)

Vietnamese often repeats a word to turn it into a softer or more descriptive adverb.

<pre>
Đi <b>thong thả</b>.
“Go <b>leisurely/calmly</b>.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Bạn làm việc rất <b>giỏi</b>.
“You work very <b>well</b>.”
</pre>

<pre>
Chúng tôi <b>hay</b> gặp nhau.
“We <b>frequently</b> meet each other.”
</pre>

<pre>
Con mèo ngủ <b>ngon</b>.
“The cat sleeps <b>soundly</b>.”
</pre>

<pre>
Đừng đi <b>nhanh quá</b>.
“Don't go <b>too fast</b>.”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Notice that many adverbs in Vietnamese are actually the same words as adjectives. For example, **nhanh** can mean "fast" (adjective) or "fast/quickly" (adverb). The context and the word order tell you which one it is. As you listen, pay attention to the "rhythm" of frequency words vs. manner words—it will help you place them naturally in your own sentences.
