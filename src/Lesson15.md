# Lesson 15: Aspect markers: đã, đang, sẽ, rồi, từng

Since Vietnamese verbs don't change their form, we use small words called **aspect markers** to show _when_ or _how_ an action happens. The most important thing to know is that these markers are often **optional** if the context is already clear.

### The Big Three

- **đang** (Ongoing): Place this before the verb to show something is happening right now.
  <pre>Tôi <b>đang</b> học. (I <b>am</b> studying.)</pre>
- **đã** (Past): Place this before the verb for past actions.
  <pre>Tôi <b>đã</b> ăn. (I <b>[past]</b> ate.)</pre>
- **sẽ** (Future): Place this before the verb for future actions.
  <pre>Tôi <b>sẽ</b> đi. (I <b>will</b> go.)</pre>

### Completion with **rồi**

Unlike the markers above, **rồi** goes at the **end** of the sentence. It means "already" and is used extremely often to show a change in state or a finished task.

<pre>
Tôi ăn <b>rồi</b>.
“I <b>already</b> ate.”
</pre>

### Experience with **từng**

Use **từng** before a verb to talk about something you have done at least once in your life (similar to "ever" or "have once").

<pre>
Tôi <b>từng</b> đến Pháp.
“I have <b>once</b> been to France.”
</pre>

### Examples

<pre>
Mẹ <b>đang</b> nấu cơm.
“Mom <b>is</b> cooking.”
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>sẽ</b> gọi lại sau.
“He <b>will</b> call back later.”
</pre>

<pre>
Em làm xong <b>rồi</b>.
“I’ve <b>already</b> finished.”
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn <b>từng</b> ăn món này chưa?
“Have you <b>ever</b> eaten this dish?”
</pre>

### Note on nuance

In real conversations, Vietnamese speakers drop **đã** and **sẽ** much more often than English speakers drop "did" or "will." If you say "Yesterday I go," the "Yesterday" already does the work. **Đang** and **rồi**, however, are used very frequently because they add important information about the _flow_ of the action.
