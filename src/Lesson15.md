# Lesson 15: Aspect markers: đã, đang, sẽ, rồi, từng

Since verbs don't change form, Vietnamese uses "aspect markers"—small words placed before or after the verb—to clarify the status of an action.

### Process markers

Three common markers go **before** the verb:
- **đang** (ongoing / -ing)
- **đã** (past / completion)
- **sẽ** (future / will)

<pre>
Tôi <b>đang</b> học.
"I <b>am</b> studying."
</pre>

<pre>
Tôi <b>sẽ</b> đi.
"I <b>will</b> go."
</pre>

### Completion with "rồi"

**Rồi** goes at the **end** of a sentence to show that something is already finished or a state has changed ("already").

<pre>
Tôi ăn <b>rồi</b>.
"I (have) eaten <b>already</b>."
</pre>

<pre>
Em làm xong <b>rồi</b>.
"I finished <b>already</b>."
</pre>

### Experience with "từng"

Use **từng** before a verb to express that you have "once" or "ever" done something in the past.

<pre>
Tôi <b>từng</b> đến Pháp.
"I have <b>once</b> been to France."
</pre>

### Redundancy Avoidance

These markers are often **optional**. If you say "Tomorrow I go," the word "Tomorrow" is enough; you don't strictly need **sẽ**. Vietnamese tends to drop **đã** and **sẽ** if the context is clear, but **đang** and **rồi** are used frequently to emphasize the flow of events.

### Examples

<pre>
Mẹ <b>đang</b> nấu cơm.
"Mom <b>is</b> cooking."
</pre>

<pre>
Bạn <b>từng</b> ăn món này chưa?
"Have you <b>ever</b> eaten this dish?"
</pre>

<pre>
Anh ấy <b>sẽ</b> gọi lại sau.
"He <b>will</b> call back later."
</pre>

### Note on nuance

Think of these words as highlighters. You use them when you want to spotlight *when* or *how* the action is happening. If the timing isn't the point, you can often leave them out.
