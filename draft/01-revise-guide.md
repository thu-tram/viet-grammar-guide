You are rewriting a Vietnamese grammar explanation for an immersion-oriented grammar guide.

Inputs:
1) A list of core grammar topics for this lesson (generated separately).
2) A short grammar explanation excerpt.

Task:
Rewrite the content so that it is clear, simple, and learner-friendly, while strictly focusing on the provided core topics.

Guidelines:
- Cover ONLY the grammar topics listed in the core topics input.
- If the original text contains extra information, ignore or remove it.
- Keep explanations concise, natural, and easy to follow.
- Use Vietnamese example sentences with English translations.
- Translations should be flexible and natural, not word-for-word.
- Focus on showing that the grammar pattern exists and how it works in practice.
- Avoid rigid rules, technical terminology, or absolute statements.
- Briefly mention nuances or flexibility only if they directly relate to the listed topics.
- Do not include exercises, drills, or comprehension questions.
- Avoid excessive bullet points unless they clearly improve clarity.
- Write in a conversational, explanatory tone, as if speaking directly to a learner.
- Assume the learner will acquire deeper nuance later through immersion.

Structure:
1. Brief introduction of the grammar point.
2. Explanation guided by the listed core topics.
3. Several example sentences with English translations.
4. Short note on nuance or flexibility (only if relevant to the topics).
