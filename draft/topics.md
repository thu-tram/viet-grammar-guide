### Lesson 1

- Topic–comment structure as the core sentence pattern
- Difference between topic and grammatical subject
- Typical Vietnamese word order (Topic + Comment)
- Flexibility of word order compared to English
- Topic fronting for emphasis or context
- Omission of explicit subjects when context is clear
- Meaning driven by context rather than position alone

### Lesson 2

- Expressing state and identity
- Using “là” to link nouns or define identity
- Sentences without “là” (zero copula)
- Difference between classification and description
- Adjectives and stative verbs as predicates
- Context-driven interpretation of “being”
- Optionality of “là” depending on structure and meaning

### Lesson 3

- Nouns without articles or plural marking
- Bare nouns as default form
- General vs specific meaning from context
- Nouns referring to classes, things, or concepts
- Optional use of markers to specify or limit reference
- Context-driven interpretation of number and definiteness

### Lesson 4

- Verbs without conjugation or agreement
- Single verb form across persons and numbers
- No tense marking on the verb itself
- Time and aspect expressed outside the verb
- Verb as predicate without a copula
- Meaning shaped by context rather than verb form

### Lesson 5

Adjectives as Stative Verbs

- **Adjectives as "to be [adjective]":** Recognizing that words like _đẹp_ (beautiful) or _cao_ (tall) already contain the "is/am/are" meaning.
- **The omission of "là":** Noticing that "Subject + Adjective" is a complete sentence (e.g., _Em đẹp_, not _Em là đẹp_).
- **Direct negation with "không":** Observing that adjectives are negated just like verbs (e.g., _không cao_).
- **State vs. Action:** Distinguishing between words that describe a quality/condition and words that describe an activity.
- **Adjectives in Topic–Comment:** Seeing how an adjective functions as the "comment" about a "topic."
- **Intransitive nature:** Understanding that these words describe the subject's state without needing an object.

### Lesson 6: Modifying nouns with adjectives and verb phrases

* **The Post-Noun Position:** Noticing that descriptions follow the thing they describe (e.g., *xe đỏ* for "red car").
* **Adjectives as Modifiers:** Recognizing that the same "stative verbs" from Lesson 5 now act as descriptive labels.
* **Verb Phrases as Modifiers:** Observing how an entire action can describe a noun directly (e.g., "the person [who] eats bread" becomes *người ăn bánh*).
* **Absence of Relative Pronouns:** Noticing the lack of words like "who," "which," or "that" to link a noun to its description.
* **The "Main Idea First" Pattern:** Recognizing the consistent logic of [Noun] + [Detail/Description].
* **Stacked Modifiers:** Seeing how multiple words can follow a noun to narrow down exactly which one is being discussed (e.g., *xe đỏ cũ* for "old red car").


### Lesson 7: Possession with “của” and noun–noun structures

* **The Owner Follows the Owned:** Noticing that the possessor always comes after the object (e.g., *xe tôi* for "my car").
* **The Optional Marker "của":** Recognizing *của* as a dedicated word for "belonging to" or "of."
* **Direct Noun–Noun Possession:** Observing that *của* is often omitted in close relationships or everyday items (e.g., *nhà mẹ* for "mom’s house").
* **Consistency with "Main Idea First":** Seeing how possession follows the same word-order logic as adjectives and verb phrases.
* **Identifying Relationship vs. Ownership:** Noticing how the same structure is used for people (*bạn tôi* - "my friend") and objects (*sách tôi* - "my book").
* **Clarifying with "của":** Recognizing that *của* is used more frequently when the sentence is long or when emphasis is needed to avoid confusion.
