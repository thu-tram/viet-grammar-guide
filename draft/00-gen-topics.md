You are helping design an immersion-oriented Vietnamese grammar guide.

Input: a lesson title from the guide.

Task:
From the lesson title alone, list the core grammar topics and ideas that a learner should become aware of in this lesson.

Guidelines:
- Focus on what the learner needs to NOTICE, not master.
- Prioritize patterns, usage, and recognition over strict rules.
- Avoid exhaustive coverage or edge cases.
- Do not include exercises or drills.
- Do not explain in full sentences; short descriptive phrases are enough.
- Assume the learner will acquire nuance later through immersion.

Output format:
A concise list of key topics / concepts covered in the lesson.

Lesson title:
